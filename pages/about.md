# **About Me**

I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm an enthusiastic data Scientist with a master’s degree in Economics and Data Analysis from Università degli Studi di Bergamo. With a solid foundation in business management and hands-on experience in Data Science, I have been developing my skills in areas like machine learning, data visualization, and database management. In addition to my academic and professional journey, my proficiency in programming languages such as Python and R, along with my ability to effectively communicate findings, position me as a valuable contributor to data-driven decision-making processes.
